## üîß Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. API Endpoint URLs
- **Issue**: Frontend was using relative URLs (`/api`) 
- **Fix**: Changed to `window.location.origin + '/api'` for proper server communication

### 2. Profile Update API
- **Issue**: Profile save was failing with "Failed to update profile!" error
- **Fix**: Added missing required fields (`userTypeId`, `isActive`, `isEmailVerified`) to the profile update request

### 3. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Generic error messages weren't user-friendly
- **Fix**: Added specific error handling for network issues and server connectivity

### 4. Server Integration
- **Issue**: Backend server configuration needed proper setup
- **Fix**: Server runs on http://localhost:5001 with proper CORS and static file serving

### 5. Profile Update API Structure
- **Issue**: Original API required admin-only fields (`userTypeId`, `isActive`, `isEmailVerified`) for user profile updates
- **Fix**: Updated `PUT /api/users/me` to accept user-editable fields only:
  - ‚úÖ `email` - Users can update their email address (with uniqueness validation)
  - ‚úÖ `password` - Users can update their password (optional, leave empty to keep current)
  - ‚úÖ `name` - User's full name
  - ‚úÖ `address` - User's address (optional)
  - ‚úÖ `phoneNumber` - User's phone number (optional)
  - ‚úÖ `profilePhotoBase64` - User's profile photo (optional)
  - ‚ùå Removed: `userTypeId`, `isActive`, `isEmailVerified` (admin-only fields)
