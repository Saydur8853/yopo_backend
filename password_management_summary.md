    showButton("üîë Change Password", openChangePasswordModal);
} else if (currentUser.userTypeId === 1) {
    // Show "Reset Password" for Super Admin on others
    showButton("üîë Reset Password", openResetPasswordModal);
}

- Visual feedback with red border for mismatched passwords
- Prevents form submission until passwords match

## Testing the Implementation

### For Regular Users:
1. Login as any user
2. Go to user management page
3. See "Change Password" button on your own profile
4. Click it to open modal with password confirmation
5. Enter new password twice and submit

### For Super Admin:
1. Login as Super Admin (saydurrahman440@gmail.com)
2. Go to user management page  
3. See "Change Password" on your own profile
4. See "Reset Password" on other users' profiles
5. Can reset any user's password without knowing current password

## Security Note:
The self password reset (without current password) is implemented for user convenience as requested. In production environments, you might want to add additional security measures like:
- Email verification for password resets
- Time-limited reset tokens
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Two-factor authentication requirements
